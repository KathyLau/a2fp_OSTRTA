APCS2
Plan 2016/06/10

All of the following tasks will be worked on collaboratively, but certain classes or files for these tasks will be delegated accordingly when the time arrives.

Completion dates have been pushed back by a day or two since the last plan, as we expect the "non-game" applications to be easily implemented. We will therefore allot ourselvese more time on completing the game.

We plan on holding 2-3 hour collaboration sessions on Fri June 10 and Sun Jun 12 to maximize communication and effectiveness.
Priorities in order of planned completion:

Planning Operations: COMPLETE
	 Planning operations, listed in our previous plan, have been completed. We will continue to update UMLs, but everything else is done.

Core Applications:
  1. Tower Defense Game - half of the classes, gain basic understanding (6/10)
     	-Tower, monster, and player classes have been completed. COMPLETE
        -work on implementing the gameplay flowchart and actual actions (6/11) IN PROGRESS 
	      o build a main driver file which will make the above classes interact with each other (6/11) IN PROGRESS
	      o work on algorithms and AI to produce enemy bases (6/11)
        -improved graphics and animation later (6/11)
  2. Clock system + alarm (6/12)
  3. Calculator (6/13)
  4. Calendar (6/13)
  5. PacMan (6/13)

The following supplemental applications will most likely be scratched due to time constraints. 
Supplemental Applications (with concepts that need to be researched):
  1. Weather (need to know about APIs)
  2. Messenger(need to know about sockets/ports)
