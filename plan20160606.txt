Team One Syste to Ruel Them All -- Kathy Lau, Calvin Vuong, Ruochong Wu
APCS2
Plan 2016/06/06

All of the following tasks will be worked on collaboratively, but certain classes or files for these tasks will be delegated accordingly when the time arrives.
If our team feels that we are working at a good pace, we may work on two different tasks at the same time and delegate responsibilites accordingly.

Completion date goals have not been changed since the last plan, as we believe that we are mostly on schedule. However, the previously listed supplemental applications have been scrapped.

Priorities in order of planned completion:

Planning Operations: COMPLETE
	 Planning operations, listed in our previous plan, have been completed. We will continue to update UMLs, but everything else is done.

Core Applications:
  1. Tower Defense Game - half of the classes, gain basic understanding (6/10)
     	-Tower, monster, and player classes have been completed. COMPLETE
        -work on implementing the gameplay flowchart and actual actions (6/8) 
	      o build a main driver file which will make the above classes interact with each other (6/6)
	      o work on algorithms and AI to produce enemy bases (6/8)
        -improved graphics and animation later (6/10)
  2. Clock system + alarm (6/10)
  3. Calculator (6/11)
  4. Calendar (6/11)
  5. PacMan (6/12)

The following supplemental applications will most likely be scratched due to time constraints. 
Supplemental Applications (with concepts that need to be researched):
