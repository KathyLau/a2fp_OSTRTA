GAME MANUAL:
You should already know the premise of the game. See "Clash of Clans" or "Backyard Monsters."
Gameplay mechanisms should be pretty intuitive. The following are things you might miss:

1. To move towers, simply drag them!
2. To show the range of a defense tower, click on them once. To turn off range, click again.
3. The HP of some buildings and mosnters are show to its bottom right.
4. Feeling powerful? Attack and AI base! Click attack, select your monsters to send to war, select difficulty, and off you go! 
     - Click a place to lanch all your monsters at once! It won't let you launch to close to a tower though.
     - The more destruction, the more resources gained!
5. Once in a while, an AI enemy will attack you! Just sit back and hope your base doesn't get destroyed. The more destruction, the more resources lost.
     - Don't wanna wait? Click invoke AI attack to start the assault!
6. For a reminder of what monsters are being created, click on view monster queue. It'll show you the queue of monsters to be made and when they'll be ready.
7. Once in a while, click Collect Resources to harvest the materials from your resource generators.
8. Click on home button to return home.
Good luck!
